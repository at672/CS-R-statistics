# CS-R-statistics
Code Samples of statistics work in R

This repo contains a collection of source code files completing all of the laboratory exercises in the textbook *Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering with R examples Second Edition* by David Ruppert and David S. Matteson. This textbook was used for a graduate level course of statistics I took while attending my undergraduate studies at Cornell. The course referenced the textbook, but did not assign all of the laboratory exercises and so I did not complete them all in the course. Recently as a way to practice R and showcase my R skills I decided to complete all of the laboratory exercises. The answers to the questions asked are included in the source code files as comments.

For copyright reasons I cannot upload the textbook itself. I can provide the data if requested.
